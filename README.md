> A project for friends. 

Are you a designer needing to sharpen their teeth with another portfolio project, then email me at [rdev1163@outlook.com], we are not trying to wave our hands at Design, we just arn't desiginers. But we can make a mock happen. 

We did this with intent to showcase a software product that can be built quickly and frugally. Also we are hirable ;)
